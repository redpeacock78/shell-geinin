> A reusable Agent Skill for choosing clear, safe shell commands that fit the active shell and its native data model.

## 🚀 Quick start

```sh
npx skills add redpeacock78/shell-geinin
```

Then let the host agent use `shell-geinin` for repository investigation,
file search, Git inspection, structured data reduction, and command design.

Invoke it from the host agent with:

- Claude Code: `/shell-geinin`
- Codex CLI: `$shell-geinin`

## ⬇️ Install

Install the `shell-geinin` skill for both Claude Code and Codex CLI:

```sh
npx skills add redpeacock78/shell-geinin \
  --skill shell-geinin \
  --agent claude-code codex \
  --global \
  --yes
```

Omit `--global` for a project-scoped install. Use `--copy` when a standalone
copy is preferable to the CLI's default symlink.

> [!TIP]
> Use `npx skills add redpeacock78/shell-geinin --list` to inspect the skills
> exposed by this repository before installing them.

## 🧠 What it teaches

- detect the active shell instead of guessing from the operating system
- preserve text streams in POSIX shells and objects in PowerShell
- filter, project, group, and bound data at the producer
- treat filenames, quoting, ordering, whitespace, and untrusted input as correctness concerns
- move to a maintained tool such as `awk`, `sed`, `jq`, `git`, or `gh` when a shell pipeline is the wrong abstraction

## 🌐 Supported environments

| Environment | Guidance |
| --- | --- |
| POSIX shells, macOS/BSD, Linux, and BusyBox | Portable text-stream pipelines |
| PowerShell | Object-native pipelines and property selection |
| Windows `cmd.exe` | Simple text pipelines with explicit quoting |
| WSL, MSYS2, Cygwin, and Git Bash | Unix-style pipelines with path-boundary care |

## 📁 Repository layout

```text
skills/shell-geinin/SKILL.md       # Agent Skills entrypoint
skills/shell-geinin/references/    # Detailed, on-demand guidance
.claude-plugin/plugin.json         # Claude Code plugin metadata
.codex-plugin/plugin.json          # Codex plugin metadata
README.ja.md                       # Japanese documentation
```

The standard `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` layout makes the repository discoverable
by the Skills CLI while the plugin manifests keep native Claude Code and Codex
CLI workflows available.

## 🛠️ Development

```sh
git clone https://github.com/redpeacock78/shell-geinin.git
cd shell-geinin
npx skills add . --list
git diff --check
```

Validate plugin metadata when changing the manifests:

```sh
claude plugin validate . --strict
jq empty .claude-plugin/plugin.json .codex-plugin/plugin.json
```
